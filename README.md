# Rencher - a Ren'Py game manager

<img src="public/Screenshot From 2025-05-24 11-12-47.png" alt="WIP Screenshot of Rencher's UI">

### why?
this was originally a ddlc mod manager because all of them suck. 

however i thought it would've been better if it supported all ren'py games

it was originally named Doki Doki Mod Swapper, then Dossier and now Rencher (Ren'py + Launcher)! üòÅüòÅ

### when?
idfk i've been trying to make this for like a year now üò≠

back when it was named dossier, i tried adding way too many features and it just slowed dev down to a halt

also i didn't know anything about how to make your code good so,,

here's [a link to the trello board](https://trello.com/b/CGaqf0xx/rencher) lmao
