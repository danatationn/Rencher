# Ren'cher - a Ren'Py game manager

### why?
this was originally a ddlc mod manager because all of them suck.

however i thought it would've been better if it supported all ren'py games

### when?
idfk i've been trying to make this for like a year now ðŸ˜­

back when it was named dossier, i tried adding way too many features and it just slowed dev down to a halt

also i didn't know anything about how to make your code good so,,

### promised features
* multiple save directories (i think i'll call them slots or something dumb like that)
* a nice looking ui :) (most likely will be made using gtk)
* symlinking base assets for mods (for unix only)
* fully portable
* other

### future additions maybe
* asset unpacking and maybe editing too
* ddlc mod list integration
* vndb integration
* other
