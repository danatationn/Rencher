# Rencher - a Ren'Py game manager

### why?
this was originally a ddlc mod manager because all of them suck. 

however i thought it would've been better if it supported all ren'py games

it was originally named Doki Doki Mod Swapper, then Dossier and now Rencher (Ren'py + Launcher)! üòÅüòÅ

### when?
idfk i've been trying to make this for like a year now üò≠

back when it was named dossier, i tried adding way too many features and it just slowed dev down to a halt

also i didn't know anything about how to make your code good so,,

here's [a link to the trello board](https://trello.com/b/CGaqf0xx/rencher) lmao

### promised features
* multiple save directories (i think i'll call them slots or something dumb like that)
* a nice looking ui :) (most likely will be made using gtk)
* ~~symlinking base assets for mods (for unix only)~~ No
* fully portable
* other

### future additions maybe
* asset unpacking and maybe editing too
* ddlc mod list integration
* vndb integration
* other

## "building"
i am not at the stage where it's a good idea to compile this soooo

here's how to run it :)

1. clone the repo (download zip or otherwise `git clone https://github.com/danatationn/rencher`)
2. install the required python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. *install the `blueprint-compiler`
4. run `main.py` :)

\* now if you're on linux getting that is pretty easy you just install it a la package manager

HOWEVER i have no fucking clue how you can get it on windows

i'll improve this later but like rn if you're not using linux you're kinda fucked,
