> [!WARNING]
> because of how rencher is packaged, windows will flag it as a virus.
> i will try to fix this in the future, but the only thing *you* can do right now is exclude it in your antivirus software

## download!
### [windows](https://github.com/danatationn/Rencher/releases/latest/download/Rencher.exe) - [linux](https://github.com/danatationn/Rencher/releases/latest/download/Rencher) - ~~macos~~ (soon)

## tips
* in order to stop windows from thinking rencher is a virus, you can try the following:
  * bring rencher back from quarantine, move it where you need it and exclude it
  * turn off cloud protection (idk why this works)
  * exclude C:\ (not recommended)
* you can turn the update toasts in the settings ^^
* if you're importing an already set up ddlc mod, then import it and set it to mod ddlc

## possible upcoming features
- [ ] store (vndb, itch.io, the old ddmc mod list thing)
- [ ] asset viewer (unrpa + unrpyc)
- [ ] discord rpc
- [ ] more...
